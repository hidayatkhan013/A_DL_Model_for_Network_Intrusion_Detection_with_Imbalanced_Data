DATASET:
The NSL-KDD dataset is used in the experiments in this study. There are 42 dimensional features 
in the NSL-KDD dataset, one of which is a categorization tag, and the other are feature tags. The 
classification variables for binary classification are classified into two categories: normal and 
abnormal. The classification labels are separated into five categories for multiclassification: 
normal, Dos, R2L, U2R, and probe.
